# Gap-crossing_task_with_CENTAURO_robot
Master Thesis concerning the planning of a gap-crossing task with the CENTAURO robot through sampling-based methods and nonlinear optimization. Then, whole-body motion are generated with a hierarchical inverse kinematics scheme in order to make the robot execute the plan.
