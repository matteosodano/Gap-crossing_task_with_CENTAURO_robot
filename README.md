# Gap-crossing_task_with_CENTAURO_robot
In this repository, the code developed for the project *Gap-crossing task with the CENTAURO robot* is published. Two folders are present:
1. Planner: contains the implementation of the planning part;
2. Whole-body: contains the implementation of the necessary parts for generating whole-body motions.

The project has been entirely carried out by Matteo Sodano and Francesco Roscia, master students in Control Engineering at University La Sapienza, Rome, and it has been developed in collaboration with the Humanoids and Human-Centered Mechatronics (HHCM) laboratory of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genoa.
Supervisors: prof. G. Oriolo (Sapienza University), drs. N. G. Tsagarakis, E. Mingo Hoffman (IIT)
